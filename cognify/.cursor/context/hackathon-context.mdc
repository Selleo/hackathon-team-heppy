# AI-Powered Learning: Personalisation at Scale - DigiEduHack 2025
AI-Powered Learning: Personalisation at Scale
---------------------------------------------

Zapraszamy do Bielska-Białej, miasta w górach!

Dołącz do hackathonu **AI w Edukacji** i stwórz narzędzia przyszłości w jednym z trzech obszarów:

*   **Spersonalizowane ścieżki nauki**
*   **Mentorzy AI w rozwoju zawodowym**
*   **Tworzenie treści edukacyjnych przy użyciu AI**  
     

**This hackathon challenges you to be at the forefront of that change in education**.   
Imagine a world where every student follows a unique learning path optimised for their skills and goals; where every professional has an AI mentor guiding their career development; and where learning content is generated instantly to fit the needs of the moment.

The **AI-Powered Learning: Personalisation at Scale** challenge brings together educators, developers, AI enthusiasts, and designers to explore this new frontier. We invite you to tackle key areas where AI can make the biggest difference:

*   **Personalised Learning Paths:** How can we use AI to analyze a learner's progress and dynamically adjust their educational journey?
*   **AI Mentors for Professional Training:** How can AI simulate the role of a mentor to provide guidance, feedback, and support in workplace training and upskilling?
*   **AI-Generated Content for Microlearning:** How can we leverage generative AI to create engaging, bite-sized learning modules on demand?
    
    The address to attend this onsite hackathon is: **Powstańców Śląskich, 3, 43-300, Bielsko-Biała**

##### AI and Emerging Technologies for Education

#### Challenge and goals

This hackathon aims to spark innovation in AI-driven education, empowering learners and educators with intelligent and responsive tools.

The primary goals are to:

*   **Foster Innovation in Adaptive Learning:** Inspire the creation of tools that make personalised education a scalable reality.
*   **Promote the Ethical Use of AI:** Encourage solutions that are transparent, fair, and prioritize the learner's well-being and data privacy.
*   **Catalyse Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** Bring together diverse minds to co-create solutions that are both technologically advanced and pedagogically sound.  
     

By the end of the hackathon, teams are expected to produce a prototype or a well-defined concept for one of the following (or a related idea):

*   **Platforms** that generate and adjust learning paths for students in real-time based on performance data and learning style preferences.
*   **AI-powered chatbots or virtual mentors** that offer personalised career advice, skill-building exercises, and on-the-job support for professional training.
*   **Tools for educators** that use generative AI to instantly create quizzes, summaries, or short video scripts for microlearning modules, tailored to specific curriculum needs.
*   **Systems** that help corporate trainers design and deploy adaptive onboarding programs for new employees.

##### Expectations and requirements for the solutions and participants

Participants will work in teams to design, prototype, and pitch an innovative solution addressing the challenge.

*   **Focus:** Your solution must leverage AI or related emerging technologies to address personalisation, mentorship, or microlearning in an educational or professional training context.
*   **Ethics and Privacy:** All solutions must consider the ethical implications of using AI in education and respect user data privacy.
*   **Deliverable:** Teams should produce a functional prototype, a working demo, or a detailed conceptual model of their solution.
*   **Pitch Readiness:** By the end of the event, your team must be prepared to present your idea in a clear and compelling 5-minute pitch to a panel of judges.
